# Deep Residual 2D Convolutional Neural Network for Cardiovascular Disease Classification
This repository is accompanying our article [Deep Residual 2D Convolutional Neural Network for Cardiovascular Disease Classification](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72382-3), which builds on the [PTB-XL dataset](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/)
## Data Preprocessing for PTB-XL
1. Download the zip file from https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/
2. Extract to a location
3. Run the file Data-different-leads
4. It will initialize 4 variables: X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test
## Instructions to run sample files
1. Clone the github repository to your local system using  git clone https://github.com/HaneenElyamani/ECG-classification
2. Make sure python and pip are installed in your system. If not, visit https://www.python.org/ to download python.
3. Code requires two more packages to run: Numpy, scikit-learn and Tensorflow
   * Install numpy ->  pip install numpy
   * Install scikit-learn ->  pip install scikit-learn
   * Install tensorflow ->  pip install tensorflow
4. Run the code file:  python main.py
5. It will output the classes for the given sample.
